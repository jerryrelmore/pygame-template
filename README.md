**Name:** main_template.py

**Description:** This is a pygame basic template/dir structure that does nothing more than help w/ preliminary 
repetitve setup steps for the series of games I'm writing this year. Update class `GameObj` name and `__main__` 
class calls to get started. Also includes `pyganim` import for easy sprite animation. I may refine further
as I get through the games this year - or, more likely, I may not haha...

Look for in main_template.py for `# TODO:` items that need to be reviewed. Feel free to refine 'til your heart's
content.
